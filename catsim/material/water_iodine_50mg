# Density souce: estimate assuming volume of iodine = 0
# Material composition source: calculated using H2O and trial-and-error iodine atoms

# Material name:
# water with 50 mg/mL iodine

# Number of elements:
3

# Density:
1.050000

# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
1    0.106573    # hydrogen
8    0.845808    # oxygen
53    0.047619    # iodine

# number of iodine atoms per water molecule = 0.007098
# iodine mass concentration = 1.050000 g/mL * 0.047619 = 49.99995 mg/mL.

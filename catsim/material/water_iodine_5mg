# Density souce: estimate assuming volume of iodine = 0
# Material composition source: calculated using H2O and trial-and-error iodine atoms

# Material name:
# water with 5 mg/mL iodine

# Number of elements:
3

# Density:
1.005000

# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
1    0.111345    # hydrogen
8    0.883679    # oxygen
53    0.004975    # iodine

# number of iodine atoms per water molecule = 0.00070985
# iodine mass concentration = 1.005000 g/mL * 0.004975 = 4.999875 mg/mL.

# Density souce: estimate assuming volume of iodine = 0
# Material composition source: calculated using H2O and trial-and-error iodine atoms

# Material name:
# water with 2 mg/mL iodine

# Number of elements:
3

# Density:
1.002000

# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
1    0.111678    # hydrogen
8    0.886326    # oxygen
53    0.001996    # iodine

# number of iodine atoms per water molecule = 0.0002839
# iodine mass concentration = 1.002000 g/mL * 0.001996 = 1.999992 mg/mL.

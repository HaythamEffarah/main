# Density souce: estimate assuming volume of iodine = 0
# Material composition source: calculated using H2O and trial-and-error iodine atoms

# Material name:
# water with 30 mg/mL iodine

# Number of elements:
3

# Density:
1.030000

# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
1    0.108643    # hydrogen
8    0.862232    # oxygen
53    0.029126    # iodine

# number of iodine atoms per water molecule = 0.0042587
# iodine mass concentration = 1.030000 g/mL * 0.029126 = 29.99978 mg/mL.

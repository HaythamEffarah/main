# Density souce: estimate assuming volume of iodine = 0
# Material composition source: calculated using H2O and trial-and-error iodine atoms

# Material name:
# water with 20 mg/mL iodine

# Number of elements:
3

# Density:
1.020000

# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
1    0.109708    # hydrogen
8    0.870685    # oxygen
53    0.019608    # iodine

# number of iodine atoms per water molecule = 0.0028392
# iodine mass concentration = 1.020000 g/mL * 0.019608 = 20.00016 mg/mL.

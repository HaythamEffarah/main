# Density souce: estimate assuming volume of iodine = 0
# Material composition source: calculated using H2O and trial-and-error iodine atoms

# Material name:
# water with 10 mg/mL iodine

# Number of elements:
3

# Density:
1.010000

# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
1    0.110794    # hydrogen
8    0.879305    # oxygen
53    0.009901    # iodine

# number of iodine atoms per water molecule = 0.0014196
# iodine mass concentration = 1.010000 g/mL * 0.009901 = 10.00001 mg/mL.

# Density souce: estimate assuming volume of iodine = 0
# Material composition source: calculated using H2O and trial-and-error iodine atoms

# Material name:
# water with 15 mg/mL iodine

# Number of elements:
3

# Density:
1.015000

# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
1    0.110248    # hydrogen
8    0.874974    # oxygen
53    0.014778    # iodine

# number of iodine atoms per water molecule = 0.0021294
# iodine mass concentration = 1.015000 g/mL * 0.014778 = 14.99967 mg/mL.

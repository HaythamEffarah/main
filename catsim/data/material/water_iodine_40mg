# Density souce: estimate assuming volume of iodine = 0
# Material composition source: calculated using H2O and trial-and-error iodine atoms

# Material name:
# water with 40 mg/mL iodine

# Number of elements:
3

# Density:
1.040000

# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
1    0.107598    # hydrogen
8    0.853940    # oxygen
53    0.038462    # iodine

# number of iodine atoms per water molecule = 0.0056785
# iodine mass concentration = 1.040000 g/mL * 0.038462 = 40.00048 mg/mL.

# Density souce: estimate assuming volume of iodine = 0
# Material composition source: calculated using H2O and trial-and-error iodine atoms

# Material name:
# water with 1 mg/mL iodine

# Number of elements:
3

# Density:
1.001000

# Atomic number(s) and corresponding mass fraction(s):
1    0.111790    # hydrogen
8    0.887211    # oxygen
53    0.000999    # iodine

# number of iodine atoms per water molecule = 0.0001419
# iodine mass concentration = 1.001000 g/mL * 0.000999 = 0.999999 mg/mL.
